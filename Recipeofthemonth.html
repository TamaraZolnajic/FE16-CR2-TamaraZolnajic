        <h3>Sarma is a traditional dish of Serbian cuisine. Traditionally, it is made from a mixture of minced meat, rice and spices wrapped in sauerkraut.</h3>
        <p>This recipe for Serbian stuffed cabbage, or sarma, is a hearty dish that many Serbs serve every day but especially for special occasions like slavas and other holidays. Recipes vary from cook to cook, but they all consist of a meat filling wrapped in cabbage and cooked over sauerkraut. This recipe includes a tomato sauce for more flavor.</p>
        <p>Some people use imported or homemade whole heads of brined cabbage (sauerkraut) known as kiseli kupus when making their sarma. This recipe uses steamed cabbage leaves to wrap the filling and cooks atop a bed of shredded cabbage and sauerkraut.</p>
        <p>Sarma, or Serbian stuffed cabbage, is a meal in and of itself and needs little accompaniment. A side of fresh bread or potato salad makes it a feast, or try starting with soup like pasulj.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>1 head cabbage</li> &nbsp;
                <li>1 pound ground chuck</li> &nbsp;
                <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li> &nbsp;
                <li>1 cup raw rice, rinsed</li> &nbsp;
                <li>1 package dehydrated onion soup mix</li> &nbsp;
                <li>1 jar sauerkraut, rinsed and drained</li> &nbsp;
                <li>6 medium smoked ribs, ham hocks, or other smoked meat</li>&nbsp;
                <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Steps to make it:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Steam the head of cabbage until the outer leaves are limp, then cool slightly and separate the leaves.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>With a paring knife, remove the tough ribs from the leaves without damaging them. Reserve the tougher outer leaves, but don't use for rolling.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the ground chuck, ground pork, rice, and onion soup mix.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>Adding a small amount of water will make the mixture easier to handle.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>Heap 2 tablespoons of filling onto each steamed, prepared cabbage leaf, and fold the bottom of the cabbage leaf up over the meat. Fold sides to the center and roll away from yourself to encase completely. Repeat until the meat filling is gone.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>Heat oven to 350 F. Discard the cabbage core and coarsely chop any remaining cabbage except the tough outer leaves you have reserved.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>Spread the chopped cabbage on the bottom of a large casserole dish or Dutch oven. Add the drained sauerkraut.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>Layer on the cabbage rolls, seam-side down.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>Cut the smoked ribs into pieces. Space the ribs or other smoked meat of choice between the cabbage rolls, and cover rolls with reserved tough outer leaves.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>Mix tomato sauce and soup with enough water to make a liquidy consistency and pour over rolls until mixture is level with rolls, but not over the top.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>Cover the casserole dish and bake 1 hour, then reduce temperature to 325 F and bake for 2 more hours.</li>&nbsp;
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
